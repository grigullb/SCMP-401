Bennett's SCMP 401 Project Notebook

29/1/18

Currently, we have a potential advisor in Professor Glandon. We inted to meet with him tomorrow to, hopefully, finalize a potential project. The minimum goal for the meeting will be to have a more narrow field to focus on so that we can develop an idea, and then meet with him again to finailize the idea. 

We want to be able to start working on the porject by next week. So that would require that we know our project, but have also divided our responsibilites, know our language and at least know a place to start. The minumum requirement for the week is to have completed our project proposal for a presentation on Monday, and then be able to work on it starting next week.
