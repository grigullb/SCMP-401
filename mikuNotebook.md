#### January 30, 2018
Met with Professor Glandon and Bennett to discuss project ideas.

Meeting notes:
- Stock returns are forecastable in the medium to long run
- Use the latest thinking on forecasting future distribution of returns
  - Use price-earnings ratio of market and some measure of volatility
  - Write a function that takes starting value, number of years to simulate, expected returns, and standard deviation of returns as inputs. Output is a vector of length n where n is the number of years to simulate with each row corresponding to a year in the future.
- Will be using Python
