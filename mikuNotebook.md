Met with Professor Glandon and Bennett to discuss project ideas.
Notes from meeting:
  Stock returns are forecastable in the medium to long run
  Use price-earnings ratio of market and some measure of volatility
  Write a function that takes starting value, number of years to simulate, expected returns, standard deviation return, and output is a vector with each row corresponding to a year in the future. Vector is length n where n is number of years to siumlate.
  Python has broader applications, and Glandon can help with Python.
